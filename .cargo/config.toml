# Static linking configuration removed from here to avoid proc-macro compilation issues
# The +crt-static flag breaks proc-macro compilation and must not be set globally
# or in target-specific configs that might be auto-detected.
# 
# For static builds, use RUSTFLAGS environment variable in CI/build scripts instead.

# Keep linker specifications but remove rustflags that break proc-macros
