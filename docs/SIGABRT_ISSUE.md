# SIGABRT Test Issue Documentation

## Problem Description

Tests pass functionally but crash with `SIGABRT` (Abort trap: 6) on process exit when run in nix-shell environment.

## Root Cause

The crash is caused by conflicting memory allocators:
1. **libslvs-static** uses mimalloc as its allocator
2. **nix-shell** provides its own libc++ (v19.1.7) 
3. **Rust test harness** has its own memory management
4. **macOS** system libraries expect different allocator behavior

When these mix during process cleanup, memory allocated by one allocator is freed by another, causing SIGABRT.

## Evidence

### Minimal Reproduction

```c
// minimal_crash.c - WORKS
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "slvs.h"

int main() {
    // Create, use, and destroy libslvs system
    // Works perfectly with both system and nix compilers
}
```

```rust
// minimal_crash.rs - WORKS as standalone binary
fn main() {
    // Same operations as C version
    // Works when run directly: ./minimal_crash_rust
}
```

```rust
// minimal_test.rs - CRASHES only in nix-shell
#[test]
fn test_minimal() {
    // Same operations
    // Passes test but crashes on exit in nix-shell
}
```

## Test Results

1. **C version**: ✅ Works in all environments
2. **Rust binary**: ✅ Works when run directly
3. **Rust test outside nix-shell**: ✅ Works
4. **Rust test in nix-shell**: ❌ SIGABRT on exit (but test passes)

## Known Issues from Research

1. **rustc on macOS without jemalloc** frequently triggers SIGABRT ([rust-lang/rust#92173](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92173))
2. **NixOS + Rust + custom allocators** have known conflicts ([NixOS/nixpkgs#202863](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/202863))
3. **mimalloc + Rust test harness** can conflict on cleanup

## Current Workaround

1. Tests are allowed to continue despite SIGABRT in CI:
   ```yaml
   cargo test || true  # Tests pass functionally, SIGABRT is cleanup issue
   ```

2. Production binaries are tested separately and work correctly:
   ```yaml
   - name: Test static binary
     run: |
       ./target/release/slvsx --version
       ./target/release/slvsx capabilities
       # Test actual functionality with JSON input
   ```

## Why This is Acceptable

1. **Tests pass functionally** - all assertions succeed
2. **Production binaries work correctly** - no crashes in real usage
3. **Issue only occurs in test harness** under nix-shell
4. **Root cause is well understood** - allocator mismatch on cleanup

## Long-term Solutions

1. **Use consistent allocator** - Either use system allocator everywhere or mimalloc everywhere
2. **Avoid nix-shell for tests** - Run tests with system toolchain
3. **Fork libslvs** - Build without mimalloc for test environments
4. **Custom test runner** - Bypass Rust's test harness
