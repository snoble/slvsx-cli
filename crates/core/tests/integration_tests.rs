// Integration tests for slvsx-core
// 
// Note: The original tests in this file were for gear/mesh functionality
// that was removed in commit dedd058. The project now focuses on general 
// constraint solving without specialized gear/mesh features.
//
// TODO: Add new integration tests for the current constraint solving API
// including tests for:
// - Point constraints
// - Distance constraints  
// - Line constraints
// - Circle constraints
// - Parallel/perpendicular constraints
// - Angle constraints
// - Workplane constraints
